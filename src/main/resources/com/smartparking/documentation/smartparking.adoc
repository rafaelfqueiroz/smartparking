	* ThingSpeak - IoT Plataform: see https://thingspeak.com/.
	* User Smartphine: receive the notification of the free parking lot.
	* Raspberry: manages the parking lot sensors according to the "commands" send from the Web Service.

== Web Service

This section describes how you can make HTTP requests for the web service.
When a car comes, its necessary notificate the web service. 
It can be done sending a post request as described bellow:

----
